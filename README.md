# PHP-Collection
A small collection of brief PHP scripts I've written in order to achieve some stuff.

#Current Scripts:

**bb_to_html.php** :  A small specific BB-Code to HTML transformer.

**beauty_date.php**:  This function transforms the ugly datetime SQL format into something humans want to read.

**remove_empty_get.php**: This script removes all empty get vars, which are not the first one, from the given URL.

**strlower.php**: Wrapping for strtolower

**deletelines.php**: Delete all lines with the input-phrase
